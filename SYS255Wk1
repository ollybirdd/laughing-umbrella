This week: configuring windows 10 and OPNsense to allow for connections between LAN and WAN

The first portion of this lab was within OPNsense; while somewhat unfamiliar, the console is really simple.
Use 1 and 2 to assign interfaces and IP addresses, while 8 will get you the shell and 7 will allow you to ping. 
My biggest issue was with "cabling" within the vSphere- remember to check all of the network adapters for the proper
connections.

To Research:
Default gateways
Windows powershell commands
vSphere settings
